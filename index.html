        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>At school you're continuously harassed and abused for not knowing how to program.
          You've decided that enough is enough and it is time to enroll in a bootcamp to defend yourself.</p>

          <h1>Track selected</h1>
          <p>On your first day of school another student you met at the bus stop says that their bootcamp is better than yours.
            He says that your code is weak and that you will never become a web developer.  Defend yourself!</p>

            <p>Interviewer : "Omg it smells like dogshit in here all of a sudden that must be the interviewee!"</p>
            <p>You start to become self conscious and sweat, you start to question if perhaps not taking a shower in two years was a bad idea.  No of course it wasn't the human body doesn't need to shower because it only strips your hair away from it's precious oils.  Time to teach this guy a lesson.</p>

            <p>John:"Welcome back student!  How was the interview I hope everything went well." He says with a smile.</p>

            <p>You scoff at his politeness and say "Ha nobody is better than me at coding I've been programming for 20 weeks I know everything!"</p>

            <p>John:"I like your enthusiasm keep up the great work!"</p>
